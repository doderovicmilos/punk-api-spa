# punk-api-spa

Punk api spa is a single page app built using VanillaJS.

It contains Home and List page.

List page shows list of beers who's details can be viewed by clicking on them.

Lists page size and page number can be altered via query params 'pageSize' and 'pageNumber' for now.

Error can be provoked by setting pageSize query param to 1000. 

Does not contain any css for now.
